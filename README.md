# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on identifying fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. It handles real-world challenges like **high class imbalance**, ensuring robust performance through resampling and precision-recall optimization.

### ✅ Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on anonymized features
- SMOTE for handling class imbalance
- Trained models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- Evaluated using ROC-AUC and Precision-Recall metrics
- Visualizations for insights and model performance

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- SMOTE from imbalanced-learn

### 🚀 How to Run
```bash
1. Clone the repo  
2. Install requirements (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)  
3. Run `fraud_detection.ipynb` or equivalent script
```
